# Azure SOC Project

## Objective
This Azure Security Operations Center (SOC) project is aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus is to setup a SOC in Azure, using a free Azure subscription. Then we will create a Virtual Machine (VM) that will be open to the internet to act as a honeypot. from there we will be forwarding logs to a central repository. We will then intergrate Microsoft Sentinel to analyze real-world attack data.

![Azure SOC Project (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efafc994-cde7-4375-80da-a117fedab649)

1. Create a VM (Honeypot) that is open to the public (intentionally)
2. Allow Attackers to attack our VM
3. Configure Log forwarding to forward log into a central repository
4. Connect Repository to our Microsoft Sentinel SIEM
5. Create an attack map to showcases where attacks are coming from
